# [Long]Dick interpreter

An [esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/LongDick) interpreter written in python.
I'm not even sure if it is working.

## Installing
- Requires some Python3? I didn't use modern features I think so it should work
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Features
- Working interpreter

## Not done yet
- Anything besides the interpretation that should a good interpreter do
- Isn't properly tested
- I plan to implement a russian translated version cuz I'm russian

## Some background
I wanted to try creating a simple interpreter and stumbled across this esoteric gem. Made is literally one evening. Code is not very good. As everything here.

## I will add example programs tomorrow
