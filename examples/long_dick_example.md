# Example showing features of LongDick language
A simple program that uses new features in LongDick

It counts to `count_to_cock` except it replaces `underscore_at_cock` with an underscore

We start by defining variables. Then we make a while loop that loops while `penis` is smaller than `count_to_cock`. In the loop we grab `penis` and then check if we are at `underscore_at_cock`. If we are, we grab `underscore_cock` and print it with `WEE`, then grab `penis` again and skip to next number. Outside of the if body, we print hand (`penis` is in hand), add one and release into `penis`.
